# arduino-load_cell-hx711
This is the code used in the context of the course: "Ψηφιακή καινοτομία και επιχειρηματικότητα". 

We use the .ino file, in order to program the Arduino UNO -connected to a 100gr load cell- and be able to weigh objects placed on the load cell. This is a Proof of Concept of the load cell's potential to weigh really light objects, such as pills. 

To run the code:

- Download Arduino IDE
- Connect with a USB cable the hardware to your laptop.
- Upload the sketch.ino, open the COM and expirement.
