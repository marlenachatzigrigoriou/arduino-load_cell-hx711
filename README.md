# arduino-load_cell-hx711
This is the code used in the context of the course: "Ψηφιακή καινοτομία και επιχειρηματικότητα". 

We use the .ino file, in order to program the Arduino UNO -connected to a 100gr load cell- and be able to weigh objects placed on the load cell.  

This is a Proof of Concept of the load cell's potential to weigh really light objects, such as pills.
